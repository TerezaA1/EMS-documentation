Day-Ahead Planning
==================

Day-ahead planning allows similar setup as in real-time optimization. It is useful when day-ahead forecasted profiles are needed. The algorithm assumes all predictions, parameters and optimal energy dispatch. Because od uncertainty, scenarios with different configurable variability are calculated.
